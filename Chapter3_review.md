## 1.What does it mean to preempt a process?
**Ans.**  **Preemption** means the ability of the operating system to preempt (that is, stop or pause) a currently scheduled task in favour of a higher priority tasko(to take a resource away from a process(or)One such resource is the CPU, and in fact preempt often
means to move a process from RUNNING state to READY state . The process involuntarily gives up the CPU.

## 2.What is swapping and what is its purpose?
**Ans.** **Swapping** is a simple memory/process management technique used by the operating system(os) to increase the utilization of the processor by moving some blocked process from the main memory to the secondary memory(hard disk);thus forming a queue of temporarily suspended process and the execution continues with the newly arrived process.After performing the swapping process,the operating system has two options in selecting a process for execution : one is selcting the new process or selecting the suspended process.

##3.List three general categories of information in a process control block.
**Ans.** A process in an operating system is represented by a data structure known as a process control block (PCB) or process descriptor. The PCB contains important information about the specific process including
* The current state of the process i.e., whether it is ready, running, waiting, or whatever.
* Unique identification of the process in order to track "which is which" information
* The priority of process.

##4.Why are two modes (user and kernel) needed?
**Ans.**Operating system consists of two modes(user and kernel) and the processor switches between the two modes depending on what type of code is running on the processor. Applications run in user mode, and core operating system components run in kernel mode.
 * **_Kernel mode_**:In Kernel mode, the executing code has complete and unrestricted access to the underlying hardware. It can execute any CPU instruction and reference any memory address. Kernel mode is generally reserved for the lowest-level, most trusted functions of the operating system. 
 * **_User mode_**: In user mode the executing code has no ability to directly access hardware or reference memory.. Due to the protection afforded by this sort of isolation, crashes in user mode are always recoverable. Most of the code running on your computer will execute in user mode.
 
##5.What is the difference between an interrupt and a trap?
 **Ans.**  
 * **_Interrupt_**: Interrupt means any kind of distubance generated by the hardware for example if some other process with higher priority wants to use the IO then it creates an interrupt to the current process.
 * **_Trap_**: If an exception arises while executing a current process then that situation is known as trap.for example if a process is performing some calculations then if it gets something dived by zero then it generates an exception such situation is known as trap.
 
##6.Give three examples of an interrupt.
 
 Interrupt |Example 
 ------------|---------
 IO interrupt|This IO interrupt occurs if any IO devices such as the keyboard and mouse demand attention.
 Timer interrupt|This interrupt occurs if some programs trigger a 'timer interrupt' for example a data-logging application that *has* to read an input sensor every 1 second.
 Memory fault interrupt|After I/O request is issued to bring in the block of memory. The operating system may perform a process switch to resume execution of another process. THe processor encounters a virtual memory address reference for a word that is not in main memory then the process  with the memory fault is placed in a Blocked state.
           
##7. What is the difference between a mode switch and a process switch?
**Ans.** 
* **_Process switch_**: A process switch(AKA context switch) is what it is called when the processor switches from one thread/process to another. This causes the contents of the cpu registers and instruction pointer to be saved. The registers and instruction pointer for the new task will then be loaded into the processor and execution of the new process will start/resume. 
* **_Mode switch_** : A mode switch is what is referred to when the cpu changes privilege levels. The kernel works at a higher privilege than a standard user task. In order for the user task to access things controlled by the kernel, it is necessary fro a mode switch to occur.
